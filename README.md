# Our Blockchain-based Healthcare App

Our blockchain-based healthcare app solves several key problems in the healthcare industry. 

### Fragmented Medical Records

Firstly, it addresses the issue of fragmented medical records by allowing administrators from multiple medical facilities to create a centralized, comprehensive record for each individual. This ensures that all relevant health information is stored in one place, making it easier for healthcare providers to access and provide accurate care.

### Patient Data Privacy and Security

Secondly, our app also solves the problem of patient data privacy and security. By using blockchain technology, the medical records are encrypted and stored in a secure and tamper-proof manner. This protects sensitive health information from being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties.

### Empowering Patients

Furthermore, our app empowers patients by giving them control over their own medical records. By providing individuals with a personal wallet ID, they can access their medical records from anywhere and at any time. This makes it easier for patients to keep track of their health information and share it with healthcare providers as needed.

### Conclusion

Overall, our blockchain-based healthcare app is designed to improve the accuracy, privacy, and accessibility of medical records, which benefits both patients and healthcare providers.
