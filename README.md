# Our Blockchain-based Healthcare App

Our blockchain-based healthcare app solves several key problems in the healthcare industry. 

### Fragmented Medical Records

Firstly, it addresses the issue of fragmented medical records by allowing administrators from multiple medical facilities to create a centralized, comprehensive record for each individual. This ensures that all relevant health information is stored in one place, making it easier for healthcare providers to access and provide accurate care.

### Patient Data Privacy and Security

Secondly, our app also solves the problem of patient data privacy and security. By using blockchain technology, the medical records are encrypted and stored in a secure and tamper-proof manner. This protects sensitive health information from being accessed or modified by unauthorized parties.

### Empowering Patients

Furthermore, our app empowers patients by giving them control over their own medical records. By providing individuals with a personal wallet ID, they can access their medical records from anywhere and at any time. This makes it easier for patients to keep track of their health information and share it with healthcare providers as needed.

### Conclusion

Overall, our blockchain-based healthcare app is designed to improve the accuracy, privacy, and accessibility of medical records, which benefits both patients and healthcare providers.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
